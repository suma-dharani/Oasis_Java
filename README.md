ATM Interface:
This is a basic Console based ATM interface application. The programming language i used is Java and executed in command prompt.

I have created a class BankAccount and intialised variable, it stores user information like user name, name, password, account number, balance, transaction history.

The BankAccount class performs various banking operations such as registration, login ,withdraw , transfer, deposit , checkBalance, transHistory.The AtmInterface class provide a user interface for users to interact with the BankAccount class and perform the operations

I have also wrote exceptions and limits for the amount withdraw and deposit.The code uses scanner class to take inputs fromthe user and exception handling to handle errors in input.
